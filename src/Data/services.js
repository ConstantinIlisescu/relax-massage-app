          "Fire cupping is a therapeutic treatment that involves placing glass cups on the skin and creating a vacuum by briefly heating the air inside the cup. As the air cools, it creates suction, drawing the skin and underlying tissues into the cup. This technique is believed to help improve blood circulation, release muscle tension, and promote healing. The cups are typically left in place for 15 to 20 minutes and later moved along the skin in a gliding motion. Fire cupping can leave temporary marks on the skin, but it is generally a safe and effective treatment for various conditions, including muscle pain and inflammation.",

This is followed by the application of a customised mask that addresses specific skin concerns, such as hydration, brightening, or purifying. The mask is left on for a specified time to allow for deep penetration and nourishment. Finally, the facial concludes with a hydrating step, where a moisturiser or serum is applied to replenish and lock in moisture, leaving the skin refreshed and glowing.
